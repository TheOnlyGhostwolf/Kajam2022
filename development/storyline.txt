=== SCRIPT ===

ah, the smell and sound of quickmart
i need to grab a few things first
before going back home

you could get lost easily
between all these aisles too

<transition to chocolate>
Should I buy chocolate?
- yes
- I love chocolate!

<transition to milk>
the last pack of milk
Should I buy it?
- yes (good ending)
- no (hell ending)

<transition to a disgusting mass>
should i...?
- yes
- no

<go to checkout>
<blurred face casher>
that's all?
OR
are you sure you want to buy
...that thing?
whatever just go

<view to the exit with other people with blurred faces or something>
i head out towards the exit

<scene outside - parking lot, forest in front>
the only back home is through that forest
...

<car passes by or something>
<scene switches to inside the forest - looking up>
it feels so calm
...
you're enjoying the view
of how the trees are dancing
to the music of wind

<switch to the path view, with a void forward>
people call this path the cursed one
besides my classmate disappearing
i have no idea why people do that

<forest bed>
you've stumbled upon "forest bed"
would you like to rest?

- I'll rest here
- [shaking] No

{yes}
<looking up again, grass like from porter's albums on the sides>
...
[Shaking] feels as if someone else is laying with you.
... long pause
You feel them leave
<blank visuals>
Your eyelashes feel heavy and you fall asleep
<switch to night forest>
you wake up after a peaceful sleep
but your groceries are nowhere to be seen
<switch to forest bed at night>
you get up and start walking back home
<new dark path with a red color glowing light source somewhere and fireflies too>
you lose the track of your path
and you get lost in the woods
you see a glowing light somewhere between the trees
Do you proceed to go there?

- [shaking] yes -> i guess i've got nowhere else to go
- no -> you feel too scared to walk into the dark again

you proceed to follow the strange light

the light leads you to an old wooden house
you go inside

<inside>
...
there's a mysterious shadow figure
coming towards you
<shadow figure near player>
A new guest, I see!
Welcome! I was expecting you, actually.
I hope that meeting Pugo earlier today wasn't too scary

<strange looking dog>
it looks funny
> he's cute, isn't he?

(proceed to {continuation})

{no}
<dark path view>
you feel them behind your back
getting closer and closer to you
suddenly
a tremendous pain pierces your leg
<falling down sounds>
<looks at the creature>
the last thing you can see
are the glowing hellish eyes in front of you
before you fall unconscious
<inside the house in front of a fireplace>
you wake up
it feels warm
suddenly, you notice a strange figure
walking around the house
it's coming towards you
> ah, I see you're awake
> sorry about meeting Pugo like that
> he bit you while you were running
> he's been a bad dog lately

<strange looking dog>
oh, so that's the creature i met earlier
> but he's cute, isn't he?

{continuation}
> Sorry about your groceries
> I took your chocolate
> for something that I'm working on
> Actually...
> You will be a perfect lab rat for my creation
> come closer to my cauldron

<cauldron scene>
> can you smell it?
it smells like earwax
> it's a smell of progress
> it should be cooked by now, let me see
<the monster puts its hand into the cauldron>
> it should be somewhere there
> Got it!
<nuo rankos kylanciu garu scena su blizganciu sparkles pipiru>
> my newest creation
> the taste is so pure
> that you can taste [the actual].shake spiciness
> ...
> but i can't do that myself...
> I'll need you to taste this for me
> there's no escape from this

$choices:
- do it
- taste the pepper

you take the pepper from the creature
it's so hot, it's burning your skin
you close your eyes, put the pepper inside your mouth
and you bite it

<red mass pulsating on screen>
the worst pain like you've never experienced before
has filled up your whole body
it feels like you're fighting against the force of a thousand fires

<the player opens eyes, screen tilted a lil bit>
> no other human will ever taste the hellish spiciness, EVER

<screen slowly becomes red, tarsi nusileistu uzdangalas, padaras igauna dantis>
[shaking red] FEEL THE PAIN

[red onwards] You feel your soul slowly leaving your body
Only if there was something that could save me from this madness

[Jei nepirko pieno]
Your inner organs are burning...
You lose your consciousness.
...
Is this it?
Is this the end?
-> Ending

[Jei pirko piena]
MILK! Where is it???
You run through the room with your eyes.
Here it is!
You just need to grab it across the room.
Your face is burning, your palms are sweaty and hands feel heavy.
...
You lost too much valuable time resisting the devilish feeling.
Your inner organs are burning...
You lose your consciousness.

{Ending. Satan's office, phone in the middle}
Welcome to purgatory. The Satan's is currently busy.
You're currently #53rd in line, please wait.
