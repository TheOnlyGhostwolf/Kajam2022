=== SCRIPT ===

ah, the smell of quickmart
i need to grab a few things first
before going back home

you could get lost easily
between all these aisles

<transition to chocolate>
should i buy chocolate?
- yes
- i love chocolate

<transition to milk>
the last pack of milk
should i buy it?
- yes (hell ending)
- no (other ending)

<transition to a disgusting mass>
should i...?
- yes
- no

<go to checkout>
<blurred face casher>
that's all?
OR
are you sure you want to buy
...that thing?
whatever just go

i head out towards the exit

<scene outside - parking lot, forest in front>
the only back home
is through that forest
...
jeez, it feels spooky

<car passes by or something>
<scene switches to inside the forest - looking up>
it feels so calm
...
you're enjoying the view
of how the trees are dancing
to the music of wind blowing

<switch to the path view, with a void forward>
people call this path the cursed one
besides my classmate disappearing
i have no idea why people do that

<forest bed>
you've strumbled upon "forest bed"
would you like to rest?

- I'll rest here
- [shaking] No

{yes}
<looking up again, grass like from porter's albums on the sides>
...
[Shaking] feels as if someone else is laying with you.
... long pause
You feel them leave
Your eyelashes feel heavy and you fall asleep
<switch to night forest>
you wake up after a peaceful sleep
but your groceries are nowhere to be seen
<switch to forest bed at night>
you get up and start walking back home
<new dark path with a red color glowing light source somewhere and fireflies too>
you lose the track of your path
and you get lost in the woods
you see a glowing light somewhere between the trees
do you proceed to go there?

- [shaking] yes -> i guess i've got nowhere else to go
- no -> you feel too scared to walk into the dark again

you proceed to follow the strange light

the light leads you to a glowing house
you proceed to go inside

<inside>
inside...
there's a mysterious shadow figure
coming towards you
<shadow figure near player>
a new guest i see
sorry about your groceries
i needed them really bad for my experiments
i hope that meeting Pugo wasn't too scary

<strange looking dog>
it looks funny

(proceed to {continuation})

{no}
<dark path view>
you feel them behind your back
getting closer and closer to you
suddenly 
a tremendous pain pierces your leg
<falling down sounds>
<looks at the creature>
the last thing you can see
are the glowing hellish eyes in front of you
before you fall unconcious
<inside the house in front of a fireplace>
you wake up
it feels warm


{continuation}
